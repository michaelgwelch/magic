Khans Booster Box January 2015
===============================

This was the first booster box I ever bought. It was purchased so that I
could practice building 6 different sealed decks. I wanted to get this practice
because I had no idea what I was doing during the prerelease of *Fate Reforged*
and wanted to gain more practice before the Fat Pack Challenge the next week.
